"""
Hybrid Skincare Recommendation System
=====================================

This system provides personalized skincare product suggestions 
based on user profiles, skin concerns, and rating history.

CORE ARCHITECTURE:
- Hybrid filtering approach combining content-based and collaborative filtering
- Dynamic weighting system that adapts based on user experience level
- Semantic analysis for intelligent concern matching
- Budget filtering and category diversity for balanced recommendations

DYNAMIC WEIGHTING STRATEGY:
The system intelligently adjusts the importance of content vs collaborative filtering:
- New Users (0 ratings): 70% Content + 30% Collaborative (rely more on skin profile)
- Few Ratings (<10 products): 60% Content + 40% Collaborative (balanced approach)  
- Many Ratings (≥10 products): 40% Content + 60% Collaborative (trust user history more)

CONTENT FILTERING COMPONENTS:
- Skin type compatibility analysis (dry, oily, combination, sensitive, normal)
- Advanced concern matching using keyword detection + semantic similarity
- Ingredient analysis for concern-specific recommendations
- Budget range filtering and price compatibility

COLLABORATIVE FILTERING COMPONENTS:
- SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) matrix factorization for rating prediction
- Skin type popularity analysis (what products work for similar skin types)
- User similarity calculations based on rating patterns
- Global rating trends and product popularity metrics

CONCERN PRIORITY RANKING:
Products are primarily ranked by how well they address user's specific skin concerns,
then refined using hybrid scores for optimal personalization.

CATEGORY DIVERSITY:
For larger recommendation sets (>8 products), the system ensures variety across
essential skincare categories (cleansers, serums, moisturizers, etc.) while
maintaining concern-based ranking priority.

           - Content compatibility (skin type + concern matching)
           - Collaborative prediction using SVD and user similarity  
           - Advanced concern scoring with ingredient analysis
        4. Combine scores using dynamic weighting (more collaborative for experienced users)
